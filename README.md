# Product List DApp

## Overview
This is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Hardhat and next js that manages a **Product List**. The original assignment required creating a product list using a fixed-size array where users could **add** and **view products**. An additional feature has been implemented to allow users to **delete products** that they have added.

## Features

### Original Task
- **Add Products**: Users can add products by specifying the product name and price (in ETH).
- **View Products**: Displays the list of products, including their ID, name, price, and owner.

### Optional Features added
- **Delete Products**: Users can delete only the products they have added (ownership verification is performed).
- **Edit Products**: The solitary contract is written, left to implememt in frontend.
